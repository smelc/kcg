# How To Now

Font files (`*.fnt` + `*.png`) have been generated with [fontbuilder](https://github.com/andryblack/fontbuilder)
where only the _Font_ and _Output_ tabs have been fiddled with (see the screenshots in this directory).

# How To Legacy (this method produces artifacts in the font)

The fontbm binary comes from https://github.com/vladimirgamalyan/fontbm

Generate font data with `./generate.sh`
